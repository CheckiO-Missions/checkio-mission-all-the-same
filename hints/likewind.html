    <div class="answer">
        This mission has a lot variants to solve it:
        you can count the quantity of the first element and if this number is equivalent
        with the lenght of the list - it's True, our list consists of all the same.
        Another way - convert list into the set and if set will have length 1 or even 0 -
        it's another 'True' situation.
